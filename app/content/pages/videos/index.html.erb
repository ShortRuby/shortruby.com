          I'm thinking about starting a podcast or maybe a video series.
          Would anyone listen to organized debates about Ruby and related topics?
          I am thinking about topics like:
          - ServiceObjects vs NoServiceObjects
          - VScode vs RubyMine vs Vim
          - Callbacks vs Composition and Delegation
          - SOLID vs CUPID or DRY vs WET
          The focus would not be on a side winning but on:
          How to think about each concept and listen to experienced people with these concepts why they would pick one or the other.
          I have no experience with online videos thus, this will be like a learning project for me.
